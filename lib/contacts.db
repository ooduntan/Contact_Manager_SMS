Contact Manager + SMS - Stephen
A console application for managing contacts
As a user, I should be able to add a person on my contacts list with the following command: add -n <name> -p <phone number>
This command should save this contact in an SQLite database
As a user, I should be able to search for a person’s contact by issuing a command: search “Andela” should print the Andela’s phone number. In case we have more than one person using the name Andela, it should ask: Which Andela? [1] James [2] Hellen [3] Joshua i.e. James Andela, Hellen Andela, etc.
The system should be able to send simple one-way texts to the people in the contacts. e.g. a command text James -m “We meet at Hogwarts, 3 PM, Anthony” / Use any appropriate SMS Gateway API e.g. Twilio, AfricasTalking, etc.
